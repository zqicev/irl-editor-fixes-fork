# ✦ IRL-editor

**Standalone real-time light editor for Minecraft + Iris**

*Place dynamic point lights & spotlights anywhere — with shadows, volumetrics, and per-light specular — through an in-game ImGui editor. Same lighting engine as [IRLights](https://github.com/quaIett/bbs-irlights-addon), but **no BBS required**.*

> ### 🔧 This is a fixes-fork
> A fork of [`quaIett/irl-editor`](https://github.com/quaIett/irl-editor) with two fixes:
> **Axiom compatibility** and a fix for **dynamic lights going dark far from world origin**
> (a camera-relative light pipeline). Branches mirror upstream — `main` = 1.20.4,
> `port/1.21.1`, `port/1.21.4`, `port/1.21.11`, `port/1.20.1`.
>
> 👉 **See [FIXES.md](FIXES.md)** — what changed **and how to build** (this fork needs the
> bundled `irl-core-camera-relative.patch` applied to `irl-core`; build steps are there too).

> ### 🎬 This branch also has the Flashback bridge
> `port/1.21.1-flashback` additionally ships the **Flashback integration API**
> (`org.qualet.irlredactor.api.IrlFlashbackBridge` + a persistent per-light `uid`), used by the
> [IRL Lights x Flashback addon](https://github.com/zqicev/flashback-addon-irl). Build
> `irl-redactor` from **this** branch (not the plain `port/1.21.1`) if you want the addon to work —
> the other branches do not ship the bridge. The Axiom and far-from-origin light fixes are included
> here as well, and the build steps are the same (see [FIXES.md](FIXES.md)).

## What is IRL-editor?

IRL-editor is a client-side Fabric mod that brings the [IRLights](https://github.com/quaIett/bbs-irlights-addon)
lighting system to **vanilla worlds and Replay Mod** — no BBS Mod Studio needed.

Press **`L`** in-game to open a [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/SpaiR/imgui-java) editor where you
place lights, drag them with a 3D gizmo, tune every parameter live, and save scenes to disk. Under
the hood it shares the exact same GPU pipeline and shaderpack patcher as IRLights, via the common
[irl-core](https://github.com/quaIett/irl-core) engine.

## Features

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **ImGui editor** | In-game light panel — press `L`, no Minecraft screen needed |
| **3D gizmo** | Drag, rotate & position lights directly in the world |
| **Point & spotlights** | Radius, cone angle, color, intensity, falloff |
| **Shadows** | Per-light cube-map (point) & atlas (spot) shadow baking |
| **Volumetrics** | Per-light ray-marched light shafts |
| **Auto block-lights** | Emissive blocks → point lights via a rolling section scan |
| **Patcher UI** | One-click `.irlights` injection into supported shaderpacks |
| **Persistence** | Save & restore light scenes |
| **Replay Mod** | Editor opens & works inside standalone Replay Mod |

## Minecraft versions

Each Minecraft version lives on its own branch — pick the one that matches your instance:

| Branch | Minecraft | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [`main`](https://github.com/quaIett/irl-editor/tree/main) | **1.20.4** | primary line |
| [`port/1.21.1`](https://github.com/quaIett/irl-editor/tree/port/1.21.1) | **1.21.1** | |
| [`port/1.21.4`](https://github.com/quaIett/irl-editor/tree/port/1.21.4) | **1.21.4** | |
| [`port/1.21.11`](https://github.com/quaIett/irl-editor/tree/port/1.21.11) | **1.21.11** | raw-GL shadow path |

## Supported Shaderpacks

Ready-to-use `.irlights` patches ship with the mod — apply them once from the patcher panel,
no manual GLSL edits required.

| Shaderpack | Author |
|---|---|
| [Photon](https://modrinth.com/shader/photon-shader) | SixthSurge |
| [Complementary Reimagined](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) | EminGT |
| [BSL Shaders](https://modrinth.com/shader/bsl-shaders) | CaptTatsu |
| [Solas](https://modrinth.com/shader/solas-shader) | Septonious |
| [Bliss](https://modrinth.com/shader/bliss-shader) | X0nk |

## Installation

> **Requirements:** Fabric Loader · Fabric API · Iris · a Minecraft version matching your branch.

1. Drop the `irl-redactor-*.jar` into your `mods/` folder alongside Fabric API and Iris.
2. Launch the game and load a world.
3. Press **`L`** to open the light editor.
4. In the **Patcher** panel, pick your shaderpack and click **Apply** — the GLSL is injected automatically.
5. Enable the patched pack in Iris and reload shaders (`F3 + R`).

---

## Usage

1. Press **`L`** to toggle the editor.
2. Add a **Point Light** or **Spotlight**; drag it with the gizmo.
3. Tune color, intensity, radius, cone, and shadow quality live.
4. Save the scene — it persists across sessions.

## Building from Source

```bash
# the checked-out branch determines the target Minecraft version
./gradlew build
# output: build/libs/irl-redactor-1.0-obt.jar
```

The mod bundles the shared [irl-core](https://github.com/quaIett/irl-core) engine (Gradle composite
build + Loom `include`) and `imgui-java` (binding + lwjgl3 + natives) so the prod jar runs standalone.
