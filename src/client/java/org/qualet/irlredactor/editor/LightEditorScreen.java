/**
 * Empty Minecraft screen that hosts the ImGui editor. Opening a screen frees the
 * cursor and stops camera/player input, while the world keeps rendering behind
 * it (the prototype's "viewport"). ESC closes it via the default Screen handling.
 *
 * <p>1.21.11: the ImGui overlay is NOT drawn from {@link #render} anymore. The
 * GUI pipeline is deferred (a {@code DrawContext} records commands that the
 * {@code GuiRenderer} flushes to the framebuffer AFTER {@code render} returns), so
 * raw-GL ImGui drawn here was immediately overwritten by Minecraft's own GUI (the
 * "screen dims but the panel is invisible" bug). Instead {@code MinecraftClient}
 * is mixed into (see {@code MinecraftClientImGuiMixin}) to call
 * {@link #renderActiveOverlay()} right after {@code Framebuffer.blitToScreen()} —
 * the frame is on the default framebuffer by then, so ImGui lands on top.</p>
