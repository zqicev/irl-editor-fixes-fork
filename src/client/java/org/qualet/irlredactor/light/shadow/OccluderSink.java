 * in-range caster; the shared implementation appends the args into the parallel
 * arrays with primitive args only — NO heap allocation, NO boxing, NO return
 * value. Over-cap casters (beyond {@code MAX_OCCLUDERS == 32}) are silently
 * dropped (a missing shadow, never corruption), so a source need not pre-count.
 *
 * <p>See {@code irl-core/docs/shadow-caster-seam-spec.md}. The blessed path is
 * {@link #emitFromBox}, which COMPUTES the cull-pinned bounding sphere from the
 * caster's box so a source cannot supply a foreign sphere (INVARIANT 5).
