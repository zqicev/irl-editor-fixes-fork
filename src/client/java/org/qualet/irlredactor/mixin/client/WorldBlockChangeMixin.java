/**
 * Keeps block shadows fresh when the world changes. Without this, placing or
 * breaking a slab next to a static lamp wouldn't update its shadow: a block
 * edit moves nothing, so a lamp whose only in-range change is terrain would
 * otherwise stay cached and reuse a stale depth map.
 *
 * BlockShadowCache.invalidateAt(pos) drops the cached block lists of the lamps
 * whose collection sphere covers the edit (a far-away edit invalidates nothing).
 * That is sufficient on its own now that the bake is per-light: the next
 * getOrCompute for an invalidated lamp returns a NEW list instance, which
 * ShadowBaker detects by reference and re-bakes precisely that lamp. (The old
 * global position-only scene hash couldn't see a block edit, so it also needed
 * ShadowBaker.markBlocksDirty() to force a whole-scene GL re-render — no longer
 * the case.)
 *
 * Targets the base World method so the hook fires for every code path that
 * writes a block (vanilla placement, server-sync, BBS edits). Gated on
 * world.isClient so the integrated server's World instances (same JVM in
 * singleplayer) don't touch the render-thread state.
